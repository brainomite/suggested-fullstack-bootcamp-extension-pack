# README
These are safe extension that won't take away from learning things the hard
way. My justification for not making a student's life too easy is depending
on a technical interview method, one may not have access to their VS Code setup
and should be able to still code

Besides for extensions that are for the front end, the rest of the extensions
should be language agnostic.



## List of included extensions:

- [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)
   - This will make brackets be colorized so that you can easily visually find
   the matching closing bracket for every open bracket or find ones that are
   missing their closing bracket.
   - Brackets are - [], (), {}
- [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)
   - This allows you to see indent levels via colors visually
- [javascript console utils](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whtouche.vscode-js-console-utils)
   - An easy way to add/remove of the console.logs with labels
     for the variables
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
   - A basic spell checker that works with programming including in camelCase
     or snake case variable names
   - Make your comments & variable more professional due to the lack of
     spelling errors
   - If you are like me, staring at code often makes me question the spelling of things, and having this gives me a sanity check
- [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)
   - Make a todo list, inside of VS Code based on your code comments!
   - This will work with comments that contain the word `TODO` or `FIXME`
   - Useful for your assignments, and portfolio projects
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
   - When you work on a plain website, using VS Code, this will cause the
     browser to auto-refresh every time you save your work. This way you can
     see your latest changes quicker.
