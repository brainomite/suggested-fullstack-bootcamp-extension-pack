# README

Please note: When installing extension packs, you should look at each extension
for:
1. To learn the purpose
2. How to use
3. Any special settings or configurations you can do.

## Description

These are safe extensions that won't take away from learning things the hard way. My justification for not making a student's life too easy is so that we can still pass a technical interview where one may not have access to their VS Code setup and should be able to still code.

Besides extensions for the front end, the rest of the extensions should be language agnostic.

Am I missing any excellent extensions?
Should an extension be removed?
Feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repo.

## List of included extensions:

1. [Auto Rename-Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

2. [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)
   - This will make brackets be colorized so that you can easily visually find
   the matching closing bracket for every open bracket or find ones that are
   missing their closing bracket
   - Brackets are - [], (), {}
   - By default, it cycles through three colors, and you can add more

3. [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
   - A basic spell checker that works with programming including, in camelCase
     or snake case variable names
   - Make your comments & variable more professional due to the lack of
     spelling errors
   - If you are like me, staring at code often makes me question the spelling of things, and having this gives me a sanity check

4. [indeticator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SirTori.indenticator) -

5. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
   - When you work on a simple website, this will
     cause the browser to auto-refresh every time you save your
     work. This way you can see your latest changes quicker
6. [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
   - Share your coding session including the codebase, any locally running
     terminal you can, when configured, even access a running webserver
   - Useful for when working with instructors, mentors, or even when pair-coding remotely
   - Every participant gets to use their VS Code, with THEIR font size, font,
     colors etc. Way better than screen sharing for this reason
6. [TabOut](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=albert.TabOut)
   - As they put it, it'll allow you to "tab out of quotes, brackets, etc for
     Visual Studio Code."
7. [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)
   - Make a to-do list, inside of VS Code based on your code comments!
   - This will work with comments that contain the word `TODO` or `FIXME`
   - Useful for your assignments and portfolio projects
